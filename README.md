# Tailwind CSS Sandbox Projects

This repository is my personal sandbox for practicing **Tailwind CSS** and experimenting with web design. It contains several small projects where I test layouts, components, and responsive design techniques. These are **learning-focused experiments**, not production-ready websites.

---

## About This Repository
- A **playground for frontend experimentation**.
- Focused on **visual design, layouts, and Tailwind CSS features**.
- Inspired by real-world examples (e.g., e-commerce, authentication pages), but **functionality is minimal or absent**.
- Ideal for **learning, inspiration, or reference** if you’re exploring Tailwind CSS.

## Goals
- Practice designing web pages from scratch.
- Learn and master Tailwind CSS styling techniques.
- Experiment with layouts, components, and responsive design.
- Apply theoretical knowledge in a **hands-on sandbox environment**.

---

## Current Status
- Not production-ready.
- No backend or database functionality implemented.
- All content is for **design and layout practice only**.
